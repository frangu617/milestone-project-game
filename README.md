# milestone-project-game
This game was inspired by an older game, "Every Day Shooter," where, like in my game, you control a square that is shooting other figures. Unlike mine, they had a lot more time to work on it, and a team of not only programmers, but also artists and other esential people for a game like this. Where in that game, you beat levels by surviving for a certain duration, my game you only have to survive as long as you can in a single level. You move around in my game with WASD or the arrow keys, you shoot at enemies in the direction of where you click, but if you miss, you leave a mine where you clicked for 3 seconds, this is to limit how many bullets you can shoot, as well as make you think twice when you're going to shoot, you can pause the game with "p" or the esc key, and from the start screen and game over screen, you can restart the game with the "q" key.

Some things aren't complete, but I didn't have enough time to fix them, mainly, bullets sometimes randomly dissapear when they shouldn't, and enemies pile up making a single unit if they chase the player long enough

The square, triangle, and star assets where created by me on paint.net,
